Important:
*) The snapshot should really keep a record of Nsamesystem_uncoupled and vre secondary and primary system sizes

*) Go through what Tom has suggested in read_input_script_file.h after reading the script and perhaps allow 
    some disallowed options

*) it is unclear why the tester does not exit when I give the command via '-r' to use fewer replicas

*) Go through the source and see where things like Temperature have been left to an expective else statement
   especially for move type as as there is also the NoMoves statement and it will reduce future errors if I
   introduce new types of moves or rx coords

For Later:
*) analyze_force_database gives me a segmentation fault for NoMoves:
		Reading data for force plots
		Number of discrete w positions: 1
		max time is: 1998
		Segmentation fault (core dumped)

*) Would be nice to allow automation of multiple rounds of cancellation
   However, I am moving towards using vRE, so cancellation is not important to CN any more.

*) fix the nligands routines
   PAUSED, because:
     look at this from read_input_script_file.h:
       else if(strcasecmp(param,"LIGAND2")==0) column[i]=ColumnW2;
       else if(strcasecmp(param,"FUNNEL")==0) column[i]=ColumnW2;
     So I need to talk to Rowan and Tom about what they really mean. The script file indicates that they have
     entirely different uses, but now it does not appear to be actually coded that way.

*) test that different force constants for different restraints are set up correctly for umbrella
   while using an exchange method other than non-monteCarlo

*) make the circular coordinate read-in a little easier to use

*) The sampling density is displayed as 1/2 when nligands = 2.
     - What other things might this influence?

*) add ticks at the nominal positions of plot9

*) For the tester: print out the cancellation values when loading a snapshot

*) Add WHAM solution to analyze_force_database

*) Add ability to calculate the cancellation values via WHAM instead of simple force integration

*) Add ability for analyze_force_database to calculate the MSD or some other measure of motion along the rx. coord

**) move the standard definitions (e.g. Boltzmann's constant) to a single header = defs.h

***

*) server should catch the exit signal, write a snapshot and exit. -- clients should be smart about this too if I can...

*) Check to see if this new mod for Grace in v2.1.10 will allow me to get my PagP runs going with the double PagP system.
   it might work out of the box now.
